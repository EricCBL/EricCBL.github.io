		<h1>LOOK AT MY WEIRD ASS BANANA. IT HAS SOME SAUSAGE COMING OUT OF IT!</h1>
		<img src="images/Sausana.jpg" alt="An open banana that has sausage coming out of it.">
		<p>Now image if some chickens encountered some of these while pecking!</p>
		<p>What do you think they would do?</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Ignore it since it's not part of a chicken's diet</li>
			<li>Give it a try and realize it tastes great, and introduce it to their diet</li>
			<li>Pick up a phone and get me an appointment with a psychiatrist </li>
		<p>If you wanna learn more about the chicken's natural diet - what they have been eating for billions of years- please refer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry_feed" target="_blank">THIS LINK</a></p>
